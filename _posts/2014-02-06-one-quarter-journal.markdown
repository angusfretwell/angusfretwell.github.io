Together with designer [Jana Hoang](http://janahoang.net), I designed and engineered a beautiful, cross-device reading experience to frame the interviews—a simple design allows the interviews and their accompanying photographs to become the focus and centre of the reader's attention.

To bridge the gap between editorial process and the digital platform, we created a simple and intuitive workflow for publishing the stories using [Craft CMS](http://buildwithcraft.com). This ensures that the contributors can easily and swiftly make interviews available to their audience—with near-zero prerequisite knowledge.
