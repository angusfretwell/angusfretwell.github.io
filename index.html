profile: |
  I'm a web developer and designer living in Melbourne, Australia. I endeavour to design and engineer unique and innovative user experiences. I’ve worked with clients ranging from small, local businesses, to start-ups, and larger companies abroad.

  Currently, I’m available for freelance work, while seeking a full-time position as a front-end developer or designer—or something in between. [Email me](mailto:angusfretwell@me.com) if interested.

  Other interests include fine food and wine, and experimental music and film.
